### In this project there are 2 files:
1. Queries.txt file that has the questions and the queries to get the answer to that question<br/>
2. Results.pdf file which has the question, the visualization of the answer and its description<br/>

1. Which genres have the best sales ?
2. Who are the most active artists/bands?
3. What are the countries with most special customers?
4. Who are the most preferred composers?
